# Security notes

These are local developer CLIs. They run child processes (git, gh, test
runners, arbitrary commands you name) and read/write files in your
workspace. This page states the trust model, what's been hardened, and the
assumptions that remain your responsibility.

## Design properties

- **No shell for real executables.** Child processes are spawned with an
  argument array (`spawnSync`/`spawn`/`execFile`), never a shell string, so
  metacharacters in data are not interpreted. One platform exception: on
  Windows, `.cmd`/`.bat` shims (`npm`, the `wtree` link, many JS CLIs) cannot
  be spawned without a shell (Node's CVE-2024-27980 fix), so those route
  through `cmd.exe` with each argument quoted for it (`src/spawn.js`). Real
  `.exe` programs (git, gh, cargo, go, node) and every POSIX spawn stay
  shell-free with a literal arg array.
- **stdout is data-only.** Tools never `eval` or execute anything derived
  from the JSON/text they parse; parsed data only ever reaches the TOON
  encoder.
- **Bounded parsing.** The JSON scanner is linear (no regexes with
  catastrophic backtracking); child output is capped by `maxBuffer`.

## Hardened (audited 2026-07-13)

- **`.worktreeinclude` path traversal (wtree).** A repo-controlled
  `.worktreeinclude` could name `../../.ssh/id_rsa` or absolute paths and
  copy secrets into the new worktree (a git tree a later `git add -A` could
  exfiltrate). Both the source (under the repo) and destination (under the
  worktree) are now containment-checked; escaping entries are skipped with a
  warning. Symlinks are copied verbatim, not dereferenced.
- **Option injection via `--from` / `--pr` (wtree).** `--pr` must be numeric;
  `--from` refs starting with `-` are rejected, so neither can smuggle a
  git option into `worktree add` / `fetch`. (Branch names arriving via the
  CLI are already rejected if they start with `-`, and names from git are
  valid refnames.)
- **Prototype-key handling (ght, tj).** `__proto__` / `constructor` /
  `prototype` keys in untrusted JSON are dropped during pruning. (Assignment
  was to fresh local objects, so global prototype pollution was never
  reachable: this is defense-in-depth and correctness.)

## Your responsibility (by design)

- **Pass-through executors.** `tj <command…>`, `tok -- <command…>`, and
  `tt <command…>` run exactly the command you give them. They add no shell,
  but they run what you name; treat them like `time` or `xargs`.
- **git in untrusted repos.** `wtree` and `fleet` run read-only git commands
  (`status`, `log`, `worktree list`, `config --get`) in the repos they
  operate on; `fleet` does so across every repo under its scan roots. Git
  reads repo-local config, which can invoke programs (e.g.
  `core.fsmonitor`). This is the standard "don't run git in a repo you
  don't trust" assumption, the same as running `git status` yourself.
  Point `fleet` at roots holding repos you trust.
- **Environment.** `GHT_GH_PATH`, `WTREE_GH`, `FLEET_WT`, `TT_CACHE_DIR` and
  friends select binaries/paths for testing. Anyone who can set your
  environment can already run code as you; these are not a new boundary.
- **Caches.** `tt` caches full test output under `~/.cache/tt`
  (`TT_CACHE_DIR`). If your test output contains secrets, so will the cache.
- **Autonomous sessions (pe).** `pe run` launches a headless Claude Code
  session with permissions bypassed inside the task worktree. The PreToolUse
  hook blocks specific actions (push, PRs, Cairn memory admission, worktree
  removal, evidence writes), but everything else the session runs, it runs
  as you. Use pe on repos and tasks you would hand an autonomous agent
  anyway, and read the PR before merging: that human review is the design,
  not an optional extra. Evidence transcripts under `~/.pe/evidence` contain
  the full session, including any secrets your commands print.
